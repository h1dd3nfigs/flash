I thought exactly the same, so watched on line <img alt=""Shocked"" border=""0"" src=""images/smiles/icon_eek.gif""/>  it was dire, the director clearly unsure who his intended audience was.
<br/>
<br/>
What was annoying is that they really didn't show any restoration, the engine work was glossed over with the statement that ""a piston was fixed"" , the body was taken back to bare metal (not a normal bodgers technique) but we didn't see  how they tackled any of the body faults that must have been present in a 50 year old car  <img alt=""Confused"" border=""0"" src=""images/smiles/icon_confused.gif""/> ok there was some tapping down of ""high's"" on the bonnet; staged for the camera, and we saw the filler applied, but was it an inch thick or just a few thou?. I suspect it was the latter as the body blokes turned out what (on the TV) looked pretty good; nice paint equal panel gaps, but the implication was that the body was ""full of filler""
<br/>
<br/>
Why they made a program that went out of its way to seem to promote bodging; not spent 5 quid on some metal and an hours labour on getting rid of the sunroof, why imply they were fitting secondhand, brake discs, exhaust components and shock's, why stage the phoney crash and make a big deal of surplus oil in the carbs, when they could have at least explained the original misfire...
<br/>
<br/>
I think it should have been called ""Carry on Restoration"" then at least we could have laughed at it!

87255;MikeEdwards;Fri Sep 28, 2012 10:38 am;"I watched it last night, on a ""so bad it's good"" basis. Yes, the ""fixed a worn piston"" bit was interesting, just mentioned in passing, in fact I wonder if it was a brake piston and they just didn't mention that to make it sound more complicated. I also thought it might be a bit hard to have painted the inside of the bonnet red without removing either it or the engine, but I don't know E-types that well. I guess there's a chance the PO had done that, as it looked like he had started painting red around it.
<br/>
<br/>
Would you use an angle grinder <span style=""font-weight: bold"">with a grinding disc</span> to remove paint on an E-type? I wouldn't. No wonder they roughed the surface of the metal up so much.
<br/>
<br/>
The crash bit was pathetic. An otherwise empty section of garage, strangely-voiced bloke (Alfa Romero? What's an Alfa Romero?) backs slowly into an engine that has no business being there, and it sticks a big dent in the lower quarter panel? No chance. Hard to see why it was much more than a small scrape in real life.
<br/>
<br/>
I have trouble believing that second-hand brake disc was going anywhere near the E-type, and I was quite surprised we got as far as the first ad break and they still hadn't bought the car. Would even have been better if they'd stop assuming we have the memories of a goldfish and keep re-showing bits of the program we only watched ten minutes ago![/b]"

I noted the car started off with California style bonnet mounted lights that had disappeared in the finished views.

No mention if the vehicle had been through a SVA following re-import.

I think its worse than that; Cost of mechanics can't be any less than Â£200 per day, I think there were 4  of them?  for 4 weeks= Â£200*4*20(days)= Â£16,000. Cost of car Â£12,000, leaving Â£2k for all the parts, trim, paint, overheads etc...... I have assumed the 2 clowns were free <img alt=""Laughing"" border=""0"" src=""images/smiles/icon_lol.gif""/>

Yes but can you:
<br/>
<br/>
Find a mate with a lorry load of spares that he will sell for Â£5
<br/>
<br/>
Have a rouge engine lying around  that will be invisible until you hit it.
<br/>
<br/>
Refurbish an engine for the cost of ""repairing a piston""
<br/>
<br/>
Put a new sunroof in the P5 
<br/>
<br/>
Spray the car in a different colour
<br/>
<br/>
Spend 2 days looking at an exhaust for excess of carb damper oil
<br/>
<br/>

No doubt they'll find a useable clutch assembly in a nearby lake that they can use, a set of tyres off an abandoned milk float, or perhaps some good s/h headlamp bulbs from a rusty Beetle that can be fixed up and used ""no bovva mate"".
