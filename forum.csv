If only one or two complaints are received, they won't but if the number of complaints is in the thousands, they will.


From what I've read in this forum and elsewhere, hundreds of people think the series is absolute rubbish yet they're all still watching it and writing about in forum threads rather than complaining to Channel 5 - who must be delighting in all the free publicity!"

Viewing figures will be the only thing C5 will be interested in, as this directly dictates revenue from  advertisers  .  Making a  controversial  program that maintains the viewing numbers certainly wont bother them.

customerservices@channel5.comUpdate on the MBG being 2 or even 3 different cars, I sent channel 5 questions which I don't have a copy of but along the lines of confirming if indeed the car was the same as the wreck ""rescued "" from the barn and about the validity of the 2 week restoration claim. This was the reply I recieved:




Dear David 


Thank you for your recent enquiry regarding Classic Car Rescue. 


While the production team were filming in Canada, the mechanics in London discovered some serious problems with the MGB, midway through the restoration, which meant they felt it might not be entirely safe to drive. Their original plan was to buy a new chassis, which is a common way that people restore MGBs (you can buy an entire new monocoque chassis for just Â£1000) and build on top of that. But wanting to stick with used parts, they bought another car and used the chassis from that, transferring much of the first MGB, right down to door-handles, and windows. The cost of the second car was included in the figures mentioned and the end result was a combination of the two. 


The programme aims to show how Bernie Fineman and Mario Pacione cope with restoration jobs with a âtight deadline and an even tighter budgetâ in an entertaining fashion while also giving some background into why each selected model is held in the high regard that it is. It is not intended to, and does not claim to, demonstrate the detailed effort and finance that can go into the high end restoration of classic cars. 


Nevertheless, this does not diminish the validity of your opinions and we are grateful to you for taking the time to make us aware of your concerns. Your comments have been logged in our Viewer Enquiries Report. This is circulated throughout the company and seen by all relevant personnel. 


Thank you for your interest in Channel 5. 


Yours sincerely 



Ian

The rear wheels fell off when the car was lifted on the lift. How come the transition wasn't connected?  But then the welded new brackets back on but it the underside was that rusty what were they welding too!


Good news you could win this car...Im that unlucky if I entered I would probably end up wining it! arghhhh


I just cant watch programmes like this.

87869;MikeEdwards;Sat Oct 13, 2012 5:58 pm;surely one cannot change a chassis from one car to another without using that car's registration number as this is what a reg is based on.
87876;Rick;Sat Oct 13, 2012 8:16 pm;Never mind that, since when did an MGB GT have a separate chassis? It has a monocoque bodyshell, and I am pretty sure a new Heritage shell is a little bit more than Â£1000.

 it justs get better the whole ""story"" doesn't it 


RJ]If classic car programmes are not correct in detail and how to carry out a proper restoration,how many other types of TV programmes are incorrect.

Cookery,Financial,Gardening,Antique etc etc.

 Even radio 4 has its incorrect descriptions and detail when i have heard programmes about the motor car or the motorcycle,or another topic I am passionate about.

I am sure these production companies can find better presenters.


Even our old flower Ed China has a helping hand you know.....John Simpson from Practical Classics magazine was behind the scenes at last years NEC show.

If we cannot produce a proper programme about old cars here in the UK then it is a sad old world.

87886;victor 101;Sun Oct 14, 2012 8:10 am;I thought this guy Bernie was supposed to be a knowledgeable chap with 35 years in the trade, if his idea of checking a car for rust is jabbing a screwdriver in the inner wing or yanking a wing off so it hits the floor, its a wonder he hasn't had a smack in the mouth. Now that would make interesting viewing.
